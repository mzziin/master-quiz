#### Description:

A simple console-based trivia game implemented in Python. It utilizes the Open Trivia Database API to fetch a set of 10 questions based on the user's selected difficulty level. 
The user can choose from easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels, or opt for a mixed level. The app displays each question with multiple-choice answers, shuffles the options randomly, and prompts the user to select an answer. 
The user's responses are checked against the correct answers, and a score is calculated. After completing the quiz, the user is informed of their score and given the option to start the quiz again or exit the application. 
The app handles user input validation and gracefully handles API request errors. Overall, it provides a simple and engaging way for users to test their knowledge across various trivia categories.
